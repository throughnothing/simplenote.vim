# simplenote.vim
A vim plugin to interact with the [simplenote][1] API.
Now you can take simple notes directly from your favourite editor.

## This is work in progress and won't probably work until at least v0.1.0

## Installation
Just copy `simplenote.vim` into your plugin folder. But you really want to use
[pathogen][5] for your plugin management.

Your credentials can be stored in your `vimrc`:

    let g:SimpleNoteUserName = "your simplenote username"
    let g:SimpleNotePassword = "your simplenote password"

If you don't set them, you will be prompted for your user/pass once you try to use simplenote

## Usage
The plugin provides the following commands to interact with Simplenote:

    SimpleNote -l

Lists all the notes in your account, together with its first line.

    SimpleNote -d

Deletes the note in your current buffer.

    SimpleNote -u

Updates the note in the current buffer with its content. If the buffer has no
corresponding note, a new one is created.

## Missing
- Notes syncing
- Tag support

## Dependencies
Version 2 of the SimpleNote API relies heavily on JSON. As JSON and VimL don't
really play nice together, basic parts of this plugin are implemented in
python. Therefore you vim to be compiled with python support in order to use
this plugin.

## Thanks
[mattn][2], [Tim Pope][3] and [Scrooloose][4] who write awesome vim plugins
which I took as a basis to learn how to write vim plugins.
